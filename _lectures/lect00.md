# Announcements

* **Class today was canceled due to the aftermath of rain and flooding**  

  Please go over these materials :

* Sorry, no crashers! Class enrollment is final (we are already overenrolled and will form groups immediately)

# Team

* We have two TAs: Vivian Ross and Avishek De
* We have one Reader: Kristin Hu
* There are three Learning Assistants: Justin Vo, Mateo Wang, and Matt Nguyen
* We have three Lab Sections: Friday noon PDT, 1pm, and 2pm. People in the same group need to be in the same lab section. We may be able to swap some people based on group formation preferences and availability.  

We will have a mixture of office hours / open lab hours
where the instructor, TA and LAs will be available.

We haven't had a chance to work out all the details yet.  Stay tuned.
