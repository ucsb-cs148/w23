# Announcements
* Still no current homework - we focus on the momentum from your MVPs and move towards CI/CD!
* Finish up [lab05](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w23/lab/lab05/) requirements: Your peer eval reports and response documents, **Unit Testing** 

* [lab06](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w23/lab/lab06/) will require you to go beyond unit testing:
* Implement at least one higher-level (Integration, Component, or BDD) test with a testing library of your choice over the next week!
* Second Peer Evaluation at CATME.org coming up next week. Fill out before Friday, 2pm to receive Lab05 credit!
