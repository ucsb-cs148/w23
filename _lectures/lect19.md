# Announcements
* **Important Announcement**: Final Project Presentations changed to Remote Format: 
With more bad weather predicted for next week, and to give everyone more flexibility for their travels, we decided to switch over from an in-class to a remote presentation format for our session next Thursday, March 23, 4-7pm PDT. Everyone is expected to attend that session via Zoom, which you can do from anywhere you like, assuming a decent internet connection. 

* We will allow pre-recorded video presentations or live presentations via Zoom, as you prefer! If you choose to prerecord your presentations, please list a link to it in the new Final Presentation Video Link column in the [Team Links Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dXhvtRPpwhPkopjN_JF59bV_RtqDguA2QaIEntIMFLk/edit?usp=sharing) by **Thursday, March 23, 2pm**.  

* There is *no requirement* for teams to come to Section tomorrow, but the room is available for you to meet in person to work towards the code freeze deadline, and you can get last feedback from the teaching team and professor. If you'd like to chat with a specific teaching team member, please let us know via Slack by 11am and we will make sure to be there!

* Now, full focus on finalizing your product! 
    * Tomorrow, **Friday, 03/17** (Code Freeze, Final Code Release)
* Remember: [Lab09](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w23/lab/lab09/) has staggered deadlines, with some deliverables due next Tuesday and Thursday. One of them is the last CATME survey, which is now open until Tuesday night.

# ESCIs (Course Evaluations)

The ESCI course evaluation system will be due on **Friday, March 17, 23:59:59**

Response rate as of 02:30pm 03/16/2023:

| Course ID |	Enrollment Count	|Surveys Completed	|Percent Completed|
|-|-|-|-|
| CMPSC 148 	| 73	| 11 |	15.07% |

You are likely getting reminders from the automated system about course evaluations (ESCIs). I would like to also ask you to please enter your feedback about the course.  It is very important for the university to evaluate the quality of the instructor's teaching (Question A) and the overall quality of the course (Question B).

A project-oriented course such as CS148 emphasizes learning by doing and the experience of working in teams over lectures and traditional exams and homeworks. If you see value in that approach, please do consider mentioning it as there are always debates on the future structure of the curriculum.  

Thank you all for taking the time!
