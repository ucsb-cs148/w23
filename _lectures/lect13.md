# Announcements
* **REMINDER: Second CATME peer eval**: You earn 20 points towards lab06 for submitting feedback on overall team performance via a second CATME.org form survey that you got email invitations for last Friday. Deadline for submittting these is **Friday 02/24/23, 11:59pm PDT**.
* [Homework assignment h08](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w23/hwk/h08/) on SW Design Patterns posted. Due next Tuesday. 

* **Focus on your projects**. Lab work in the coming weeks will focus on documentation (**design document**, **user manual**) in order to get your documents started and to utilize cycles of team members not central to ongoing implementation efforts at any given time. 
** Project documentation will happen in three major documents: 
    * **design document** (to be started in lab07),
    * **user manual** (to be started in lab08))
    * **deployment instructions** (started for MVP peer review) and Github **README.md**, which should explain the code folder hierarchy and guide through the implementation effort. 
* Project presentations (Final exam slot, Thu, March 23rd, 4-7pm)
